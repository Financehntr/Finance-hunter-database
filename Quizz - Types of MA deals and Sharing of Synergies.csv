;1;What is the difference between an acquisition and a merger?;"In an acquisition/ you are buying shares of a company or its assets and the acquirer and target stay legally separated; in a merger/ the buyer absorbs the target (target legally disappears) or a new entity is created that encompasses the buyer and the target";"In an acquisition/ you are buying assets of a company  and the acquirer and target stay legally separated; in a merger/ the buyer absorbs the target (target legally disappears)";There is no difference. There are only two different terminologies used/ one most in the US and the other mostly in Europe
;2;How is called an acquisition of assets in exchange of shares?;A merger;A contribution of assets;A spin-off
;3;What is a mixed offer?;An offer of less than 100% of a target;An offer made by 2 or more buyers for a single asset;An offer made of cash and shares of the buyer
;3;What is the difference in terms of economic outcome (entity post deal) between a cash/  a share deal and a mixed offer?;The cash deal is easier to deal with post deal;The share deal creates some governance problem;No difference
;1;What are the main characteristics of a cash offer?;The price is fixed/ the selling shareholders go away but are taxed on the sale;The price is variable/ the selling shareholders go away but are taxed on the sale;The price is fixed/ the selling shareholders go away but are not taxed on the sale

;3;Is an EPS accretive deal creating value for buyer's shareholders? Why?;Yes. If EPS increases/ assuming P/E is constant/ the share price will increase;Yes. As shareholders are focusing on how much earnings they get per share. Therefore if EPS increases/ there will be more value for them;No. Even though EPS increases/ we do not know what the P/E will do. Therefore/ we cannot predict the share price evolution this way
;1;In a cash deal/ is the shareholders equity of the buyer affected?;No as no new shares created;Yes as you need to add the target's shareholders equity;Yes as the company becomes bigger
;2;What are synergies to break even?;They are the synergies needed for the buyer's shareholders to get value creation;They are the synergies needed to be EPS neutral in case the deal is EPS dilutive;They are the synergies needed to be EPS neutral in case the deal is EPS dilutive and that there is already synergies in the deal

;2;Give examples of economy of scope;Headcount reduction and cross selling;Stronger and/or longer lasting competitive advantage through higher pricing power (reduced competition)/ higher switching costs/ cross-selling of products;Reduction of corporate tax rate and lower Capex
;3;Give examples of economy of scale;Reduction of WACC through a more optimal capital structure;Headcount reduction and cross selling;Cost savings on current operations (better group purchasing terms/ cut duplicated costs…)
;1;what are asset synergies?;It is an improved capital efficiency leading to lower Capex+ΔWC needed for a given level of growth (eg. capacity rationalization: airline deals/ unused plant capacity);It is an improvement of the quality of assets through M&A;It is a large reduction of asset and Capex to become more asset-light in term of business model

;3;Are 'improvement of management' included in M&A synergies?;Yes as they are part of the value creation;Yes as they are savings for the target;No as you do not need to combine buyer + target to get them (e.g. PE fund doing M&A)
;3;If a company diversifies itself through M&A/ its value will increase as WACC will decrease (ie financial synergies);True as the combined FCFF will be less risky as more diversified/ leading to a reduced WACC and then higher EV;True as diversification reduces the risk of the buyer/ reducing its WACC;Wrong as/ even though the WACC may decrease/ the overall 'quality' of FCFF may decrease as well/ therefore not enabling us to conclude on higher or lower EV coming from diversification
;3;What is typically M&A bankers role in advising clients on synergies? ;They build them bottom-up for the clients;They do nothing. Only strategic consultants work on them;They benchmark the global level of synergies that are expected vs comparable transactions

;3;In a M&A deal with a given Target/ are the potentially realizable synergies always the same?;Yes they are as they depend on the Target characteristics;No as they are different for each buyer;No as they are different for each buyer and are time dependent as well
;2;How  should expected value creation be split between buyer's and target's shareholders?;Always 50-50 or 60-40 (in favor of buyer) depending on negotiation;Sharing will depend on the following: who has the scarce resource/ who really wants the deal to  happen/ market “rule of thumbs” (transaction multiples/ historical premium paid…);All depends on historical premium paid that will decide the % given to seller
;3;When deciding on the control premium to pay/ what is wrong ?;Looking at transaction comparable;Doing a DCF of target and synergies using the target wacc (leading to the max price to pay);Doing a DCF of target and synergies using the lower between acquirer and target wacc (leading to the max price to pay)
;1;What are the classical rules of thumb used to value synergies through DCF?;1/3/ 2/3/ 100% of full synergies (post tax) in yr1/ yr2/ yr3 respectively then flat level. Restructuring costs (post tax) equal to 50% of full synergies and only in yr1 and yr 2;20%/ 40%/ 60%/ 80%/ 100% of full synergies (pre tax) in yr1/ yr2/ yr3/ yr4/ yr5 respectively then flat level. Restructuring costs (pre tax) equal to 50% of full synergies and only in yr1 ;1/4/ 3/4/ 100% of full synergies (post tax) in yr1/ yr2/ yr3 respectively then flat level. Restructuring costs (post tax) equal to 30% of full synergies and only in yr1 and yr 2
;2;What terminal value to use when doing DCF of synergies?;No terminal value after explicit period of 5-10 years;Terminal value with zero or very low growth ;Terminal value with inflation as perpetual growth
;3;What discount rate do you use to value synergies with DCF?;Use the risk free rate;use the WACC of Acquirer ;Technically/ the WACC of the combined business but in practice/ often/ WACC of target
;3;In a cash deal/ how to compute the expected value creation that will be kept by the buyer's shareholders?;Staandalone EqV target as viewed by buyer+ yearly synergy - transaction costs - target market capitalization;Standalone EqV target + yearly synergy - transaction costs - target market capitalization - premium paid;Standalone EqV target as viewed by buyer + PV of  synergies - transaction costs - target market capitalization - premium paid
;2;In a cash deal/ if the buyer believes that the target is overvalued by the market by 20/ what impact (if any) does it have on the  expected value creation that will be kept by the buyer's shareholders (vs Target fairly valued and assuming same premium paid)?;It will make no difference;It will decrease it by 20;It will not change. The premium will be decreased by 20
;1;In a share deal/ how to compute the expected value creation that will be kept by the buyer's shareholders?;[Standalone EqV of the Target viewed by buyer + PV of synergies - transaction costs - premium paid (embedded into the exchange ratio) – market capitalization of the Target] x % ownership of buyer in the combined business;[Standalone EqV of the Target viewed by buyer + PV of synergies - transaction costs - premium paid (embedded into the exchange ratio)] x % ownership of buyer in the combined business;[Standalone EqV of the Target viewed by buyer + PV of synergies - transaction costs - premium paid (embedded into the exchange ratio) – market capitalization of the Target] x % ownership of target in the combined business
